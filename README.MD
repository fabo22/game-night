# Game Night



Game Night is a social networking site that allows users to connect with groups and attend events based off a shared enthusiasm for board or video games.

End user goal: As a user, I want to explore groups, join them and attend their events based off detail cards provided. As a user, I'd also like the ability to create my own groups, host my own events, and edit them or delete if I change my mind.

End user goal: As a user, I want to share my love of games with like minded individuals in my area, possibly making friends and network connections along the way.
 
End business goal: We will maintain a database of users, the areas they attend events, what games they play, and their interactions. This could be leveraged into unobtrusive targeted ads towards the user.
 
Measurement of success: Engagement and individual contribution will translate into the growth of the data for all data entities.

## Next Steps
For future improvements, we would like to search and filter groups and events based on location, game, size. We would like to access geographical information from the GoogleMapsAPI and further boardgame information from BoardGameGeeks. We would also like the ability to reassigned "Group Organizer" role so they can create and edit events and groups in a group. As a group leader, I would like to be able to set a group size. We would like incorporate a genre model, and add a sub genre model. As a group member, I would like to see high-level event location information, but only once I join the event I should see the specific address. As a user, I would like to upload a profile picture. And finally, as a user attending an event, I would like the buttons on the event toggle between join and leave based on if i'm attending it or not.
